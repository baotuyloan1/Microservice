- Monolithic is a signle unit
- SOA is a coarse-grained
  - We are separating our backend services, but it is not going to give a lot of flexibility in terms of multiple database, multiple codebase.
  - With that reason, we cannot really separate our services or code based around the business domains.
- Microservices are fine-grained
  - They are going to have separate code base, separate development and deployment lifecycle.
